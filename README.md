## EDA and Attrition Prediction of Employees

EHuman Resources Management (HRM) has become one of the essential interests of managers and decision-makers in almost all types of businesses to adopt plans for correctly discovering highly qualified employees. Employee attrition refers to the percentage of workers who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees. A high rate of attrition in an organization leads to increased recruitment, hiring, and training costs. Not only it is costly, but qualified and competent replacements are hard to find. In most industries, the top 20% of people produce about 50% of the output. In this project, Data Mining techniques were utilized to build a classification model for predicting attrition of valuable employees using a real dataset collected from IBM HR Analytics through a survey of 1470 employees.

My contirbution in the project was to implement the EDA and Logistic Regression model in the dataset.
